# VBA-challenge
For submission of VBA-challenge assessment

The main assessment piece is named "excel-challenge-code.vbs" in the main folder. It contains the VBA code used to create the summary tables in the three provided screenshots (of each worksheet).

A couple of things to note:
  - Regarding the yearly change column - I made the decision that if the change was <=0 that it would be red, as a yearly change of 0 to a stock price would be a poor investment either way
  - The notes about Conditional formatting was a little bit confusing. I interpreted this as using VBA to change the cell colour. As for the percentage column, I left it blank, as per the exmaple data provided.


Have a lovely day, and that's for reading
